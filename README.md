# Spectral-Feature

There are various approaches to solve graph classification problem. Graph embedding is one of them. This GitHub repository provide an implementation of Spectral Feature <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09155.pdf">[1]</a> as one of embedding method available using NumPy. The calculation of this feature involves adjacency matrix and eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix of the graph.
