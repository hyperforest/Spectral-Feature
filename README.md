# Spectral-Feature

There are various approaches to solve graph classification problem. Graph embedding is one of them. This GitHub repository provide an implementation of Spectral Feature [1] as one of embedding method available. The calculation of this feature involves adjacency matrix and eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix of the graph.
